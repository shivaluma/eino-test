### Schema conventions

- UUID v4 primary keys
- Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`
- Proper foreign keys with CASCADE as appropriate
- Index frequently queried columns

### Migrations

- Sequential filenames (e.g., `001_...`, `002_...`)
- Descriptive and time-stamped
- Prefer reversible/SAFE changes; never drop without backup plan
- SQL lives in `migrations/*.sql`; run via `cmd/migrate`

See examples in [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md).
