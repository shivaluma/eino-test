description: Testing strategy and quality gates for backend and frontend (from CLAUDE.md).

### Backend tests

- Prefer table-driven tests
- Use test DB setup/teardown helpers
- Run with `go test`, add `-race` where relevant

### Frontend (planned)

- Unit tests with RTL
- Integration/E2E with Playwright

### Quality

- `go vet`, `go fmt` (backend); `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check-types` (frontend)

See [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) for examples.
