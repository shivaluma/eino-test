### Code organization

- Clear boundaries between layers; explicit DI
- Use interfaces for repositories; keep handlers thin

### Performance

- Index hot DB columns; use connection pooling
- Cache strategically; optimize static assets delivery

### Maintainability

- Comprehensive docs where non-obvious; unit/integration tests on critical paths
- Structured logging with context; consistent error handling

For deeper guidance, see [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md).
