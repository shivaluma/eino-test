Product Requirements Document: AI Food Agent
Version: 1.2
Date: August 3, 2025
Author: Thanh
Status: Draft

1. Introduction
1.1. Purpose
This document defines the requirements for a new AI Food Agent. The application will provide users with a conversational interface to an intelligent agent that specializes in recommending the best food dishes. This PRD outlines the product's goals, features, user characteristics, and technical specifications.

1.2. Scope
The initial release (Phase 1) will focus on establishing the core infrastructure for a user to have a dedicated conversation with an AI agent. This includes user authentication, real-time messaging with the agent, and the basic integration of an AI food recommendation engine. Future phases will expand on the AI's capabilities, context awareness, and third-party integrations.

1.3. Target Audience
The primary audience is food enthusiasts, travelers, and individuals who enjoy discovering new food and restaurants and are looking for a fun, interactive, and personalized way to decide what to eat.

2. Goals and Objectives
2.1. Business Goals
Establish a foothold in the niche market of AI-driven food discovery.

Create a scalable and secure platform for future feature development.

Achieve a high user adoption rate within the first six months post-launch.

Minimize initial infrastructure costs by using efficient and scalable technologies.

2.2. User Goals
To chat with an intelligent agent in real-time to get personalized food recommendations.

To create an account and log in seamlessly.

To have a simple, intuitive, and enjoyable user experience.

3. User Personas & Stories
3.1. Persona: "Alex, the Foodie"
Bio: Alex loves trying new restaurants and dishes. They often struggle to decide where to eat and what to order.

Needs: A fun way to get food recommendations without browsing through countless review sites or menus.

User Stories:

"As Thanh, I want to register for an account using my email and a password so I can start using the application."

"As Thanh, I want to log in securely to access my conversation history with the agent."

"As Thanh, I want to start a new conversation with the AI agent to get dinner ideas."

"As Thanh, I want to send and receive messages with the agent in real-time."

"As Thanh, I want to ask the AI agent for the 'best pasta dish nearby' to get a quick recommendation."

4. Features & Functionality (Phase 1)
4.1. User Authentication
Description: Users must be able to create an account and log in to the application securely. The system will use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for managing user sessions.

Functional Requirements:

Users can register with a username, email, and password.

User passwords must be securely hashed and salted before being stored.

Upon successful login, the system will issue a short-lived access token and a long-lived refresh token.

The access token will be used to authorize all subsequent API requests.

When the access token expires, the client will use the refresh token to request a new access token.

4.2. Real-time Chat with AI Agent
Description: The core feature is a real-time, one-on-one conversation between the user and the AI Food Agent.

Functional Requirements:

Users can view a list of their past conversations with the agent.

Users can initiate a new conversation at any time.

Messages from the user and responses from the AI are delivered in real-time (using WebSockets).

The chat interface will display the message content and timestamp.

The AI agent must understand natural language queries (e.g., "best tacos in downtown", "spicy noodle soup") and provide a relevant dish recommendation as a response.

A basic "Agent is typing..." indicator will be shown while the AI generates a response.

5. Technical Requirements
5.1. System Architecture
Backend: A monolithic service written in Go using the Echo framework.

Database: PostgreSQL for storing user data and conversation history.

Real-time Communication: WebSockets will be used for instant message delivery.

Deployment: The application will be containerized using Docker for portability and ease of deployment.

5.2. Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
The schema is simplified for a user-to-agent model.

users table:

CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

conversations table:

CREATE TABLE conversations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

messages table:

CREATE TABLE messages (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    conversation_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    sender_id UUID NOT NULL, -- The user's ID
    sender_type VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, -- 'USER' or 'AGENT'
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    metadata JSONB, -- For rich recommendation data, etc.
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
-- Index for fast retrieval of messages in a conversation
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_conversation_id_created_at ON messages (conversation_id, created_at DESC);

5.3. API Endpoints (Golang / Echo)
The API will be versioned (e.g., /api/v1/...).

Authentication Endpoints

POST /api/v1/register

Request Body: {"username": "alex_foodie", "email": "alex@example.com", "password": "strongpassword123"}

Success Response (201 Created): {"message": "User registered successfully"}

POST /api/v1/login

Request Body: {"email": "alex@example.com", "password": "strongpassword123"}

Success Response (200 OK): {"access_token": "ey...", "refresh_token": "ey..."}

POST /api/v1/token/refresh

Request Body: {"refresh_token": "ey..."}

Success Response (200 OK): {"access_token": "ey..."}

Conversation Endpoints (Protected by JWT middleware)

GET /api/v1/conversations: List all conversations for the authenticated user.

POST /api/v1/conversations: Create a new, empty conversation.

GET /api/v1/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages: Get messages for a specific conversation (with pagination).

GET /ws/v1/conversations/{conversation_id}: WebSocket endpoint for real-time messaging with the agent.

5.4. JWT Specification
Access Token:

Payload: Will contain user_id, username, and an expiration claim (exp).

Lifespan: 15 minutes.

Refresh Token:

Payload: Will contain user_id and an expiration claim (exp).

Lifespan: 7 days.

Storage: Stored in the database and invalidated upon use (token rotation).

6. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: API responses should be under 200ms. AI responses should ideally be returned in under 3 seconds.

Scalability: The architecture should be horizontally scalable.

Security: All communication must be encrypted via HTTPS/WSS. Passwords must be hashed.

Reliability: The service should have an uptime of 99.9%.

7. Success Metrics
User Engagement: Daily Active Users (DAU) and conversations per session.

Feature Adoption: Quality of AI recommendations (e.g., measured by user feedback).

Performance: Average API and AI response times.

User Retention: Percentage of users who return after their first week.

8. Future Considerations (Post-Phase 1)
Sharing recommendations or conversation snippets.

Integration with mapping/review services.

User Profiles (favorite foods, dietary restrictions).

Advanced AI context (remembering preferences across conversations).

End-to-end Encryption.

9. Technology stacks
